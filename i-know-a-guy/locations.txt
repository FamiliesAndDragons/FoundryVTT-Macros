// Locations

down by the docks
in the market district
at the old abandoned mill
at the local tavern
just outside town
in the nearby forest
just in the previous town
just at the next town
within your home town
in the sewers
by the goblin camp
among the ruins
at the alchemist's shop
on the outskirts of town
under the waterfall
amidst the standing stones
inside a hidden cave
along a trade route
by a sacred shrine
in a haunted graveyard
near the wizard's tower
in the wizard's tower
at the crossroads
up in the hill
across the river
a few streets away
within a magical library
near a celestial observatory
within a labyrinth or catacombs
at the entrance to the Underdark
amidst the ruins of an old castle
near the frozen wastes
within the volcanic caverns
at the nexus of ley lines
within an abandoned laboratory
amidst the shifting sands of the desert
near the misty moors
among the glowing mushrooms in the cave
in a Myconid Circle
at the lighthouse
at the top of a mountain peak
near the ancient burial grounds
within the belly of a massive beast
in ruins of an ancient civilization frozen in time
within a living crystal cavern
within a living forest
only inside of your dreams but is also very real
on the back of a colossal turtle
nestled within a giant hollow tree
beneath the roots of a sentient tree
amidst the swirling vortex of a magical storm
within the body of a colossal sandworm
within a pocket dimension
on a floating airship they call home
within the dreamscape of a sleeping deity
